# Online Library System

A modern, full-featured online library system built with React, Redux, React Router, and styled using Tailwind CSS. This web application allows users to browse books by category, view book details, add new books to the library, and navigate through various pages seamlessly.

## Features

- **Home Page**: Includes a welcome message, book categories, and a navigation bar.
- **Browse Books Page**: Allows users to filter and search books by category, title, or author.
- **Book Details Page**: Displays detailed information about a book, including title, author, description, and rating.
- **Add Book Page**: Form to add a new book, with validation and state management using Redux.
- **404 Page**: Displays a custom page for any undefined routes.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Redux**: For state management across the application.
- **React Router**: For navigation and dynamic routing.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For utility-first, responsive styling and modern design.
- **React-Redux**: To integrate Redux state management into React components.
